	      <p><b>You can support the SDG 8 by:</b>
		 <br/><br/>
		  1. Supporting Local Businesses and Conscious Consumption:
                     <br/><br/>
                     Buy from local producers and businesses:
                     This helps to stimulate local economies and creates jobs in your community.
                     <br/><br/>
                     Be a conscious consumer:
                     Consider the ethical and environmental impact of your purchases. If something is cheap, it's likely made at the expense of workers or the planet.
                     <br/><br/>
                     Support local farmers and food producers:
                     This helps create jobs in the agricultural sector and promotes sustainable food systems.
